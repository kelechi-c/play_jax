Autoregressive image generation model in JAX. Minimal implementation. 

### acknowledgement
This repo/project was inspired by curiosity and the paper, [**Computational Tradeoffs in Image Synthesis:Diffusion, Masked-Token, and Next-Token Prediction**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13218).

Most of the code was adapted/ported from the image generation training codebase, [**fal-ai/diffusion-speedrun**](https://github.com/fal-ai/diffusion-speedrun) (thank you (Simo)[https://github.com/cloneofsimo]).
