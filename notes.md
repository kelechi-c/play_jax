### JAX, my beloved framework :)

I just really love **JAX**, forgive the constant rants about it >_<.
I initially liked it, as a Deepmind/Midjourney fan and all, and the code looked beautiful.\

But after using it personally and seeing how good it was, the control, the synergy with TPUs,
 how it adapted to different environments and devices, etc, I fell in love more.

Yes, it is not widely used as Pytorch(this even makes it feel better), but it is flexible and all.
